 Git Branch Structure
#Merging Workflow
1.clone the repository,
2. fetch all the branches that I created.
> Note:All new features should be developed in a `feature/name` branch and merged into `frontend` or `backend` before merging into `dev`.

 Main Branches
- main → Production (final version).
- staging → Testing before merging to `main`.
- dev → Development branch (combines frontend & backend).

 Front-End Branches
- `frontend` → Main front-end development branch.
example:
- `feature/homepage` → Homepage UI/UX.
- `feature/navbar` → Navigation bar.
- `feature/auth-ui` → Login/Register UI.

 Back-End Branches
- `backend` → Main back-end development branch.
example:
- `feature/auth` → User authentication.
- `feature/database` → Database setup.
- `feature/api` → API development.

 Bug Fix & Testing
- `bugfix/navbar` → Fix navbar issues.
- `bugfix/authentication` → Fix login issues.
- `test/ui` → UI testing before merging.
